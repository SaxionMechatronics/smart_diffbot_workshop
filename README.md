# SMART diffbot workshop
This package is used to give ROS 2 workshops on several topics. It is inspired by our own [SMART diffbot package](https://github.com/SaxionMechatronics/smart_diffbot.git). The main branch is kept rather empty. Every workshop starts with an initial state of this package, related to the topic of the workshop. These are captured in the following branches:
* `modeling`
* `control`
* `localization`
* `navigation`

The `final` branch contains a final result after completing all workshops. 

Tested for ROS 2 Humble and Gazebo Fortress. 

Developed by the Smart Mechatronics And RoboTics (SMART) Research Group of Saxion University of Applied Sciences. This packages was in part supported by Regiorgaan SIA project RAAK-MKB Autonomous Agricultural Navigation (RAAK.MKB16.016).
